DatDot is an autonomous hosting network for p2p data systems

**Dynamic datasets with immutable history**
Due to their P2P nature it's hard to have guarantees about their availability.
If we want to keep data available and up to date we have to keep our computer running or we have to rent a server.

**Challenges:** What if you want other people to help you host your data?
- what incentives do they have?
- how to find them and to trust them?
- how to verify they are 'seeding' your data?

**Solution:**
A bridge between Hypercore Protocol and Substrate with a built-in incentive model which manages relationships between:
- hypercore creators/publishers and 
- hosters (who keep data available/host the data)

**Community First**

We're a small group of open source developers that provides social and technical infrastructure for projects using hypercore protocol
