### DatDot booth at Decoded 

We attended the [sub0](https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/sub0/) conference in Portugal where we explained how DatDot works. We gathered interesting projects on our booth and had plenty of very fruitful conversations about the p2p storage solutions in the space and what is lacking for the developers. To learn more about, you can check out the [slides](https://github.com/datdotorg/organization/blob/main/events/2023/sub0/datdot-event-Lisbon-slides.pdf), presented and discussed at the booth.

### Looking for collaborators 

We are seeking a skilled Rust/Substrate developer with a keen interest in the p2p protocols, specially dat/hypercore protocol, to join our team. If you are passionate about contributing to an exciting open-source project that aims to build the infrastructure of the future internet, we would love to hear from you.

### New grant

Our [Polkadot Treasury Proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/145) got approved and we have secured a new round of funding for our project. 

For the past 2 years we have been building the technology and it hasn't always been easy working with 2 bleeding edge technologies - Substrate and Hypercore protocol - which have during this time introduced multiple breaking changes.

We succesfully submitted our first milestone - a prototype of the DatDot system - a pallet running on a Substrate chain, taking to a service.js code, running a hypercore protocol.

After this milestone we realized that building a pallet won't be enough, we will have to also build a custom chain to support our economic model.

We have spent a few months specifying the system with the updated incentives for each role in our p2p hosting network to make our economic and security model really solid. After that we started working on the implemention of the system as a combination of chain and service.js logic while refining it even further.

### DatDot economics

We want users and service providers in our ecosystem to understand the value of common interests and responsibilities; to have solidarity with one another, and to inherently support one another in everything they do.

We want things that are usually uncompensated, but are in the common good, to be compensated - and we want this compensation to be sustainable and reliable, so that there is reason for people to work towards this common good.

We do not want to encourage monopolistic or rent-seeking behavior, and instead want to encourage generosity and positive-sum behaviour.

### Milestone 1
Good news. We just finished our phase 1 which means our datdot chain is running and communicating with dat/hyper* and does the test hosting of the hypercores. 
We are very excited about it.

**What's next?**
* [ ] making all this more robust, 
* [ ] improve the economics of the whole service,
* [ ] add the UI,
* [ ] refine proof of service, which repeats over and over for as long as the hosting contract lasts
  * which consists of proof of storage
  * and proof of retrievability
* [ ] more fun stuff 
* [ ] and after this we can finally gets some tests running
