# Welcome to DatDot

DatDot is a distributed (peer-to-peer) hosting network.

**Dynamic datasets with immutable history**
Due to their P2P nature it's hard to have guarantees about their availability.
If we want to keep data available and up to date we have to keep our computer running or we have to rent a server.

**Challenges:** What if you want other people to help you host your data?
- what incentives do they have?
- how to find them and to trust them?
- how to verify they are 'seeding' your data?

**Solution:**
A bridge between Hypercore Protocol and Substrate with a built-in incentive model which manages relationships between:
- hypercore creators/publishers and 
- hosters (who keep data available/host the data)



# Background

Popular files on a P2P network have more stability and availability than files on central networks. Accessing less popular or rare files, however, can be unreliable because sharing files in a P2P network requires that at least one node in the network has the requested data, and that node must be able to connect to the node requesting the data. This requirement is occasionally hard to meet because users may have limited access to the internet or will simply turn off their computer.

DatDot p2p hosting technology is filling this gap by connecting users into a distributed marketplace.

Peers can request hosting for their hypercore files or they can offer storage space on their computers and host data for other peers. DatDot protocol automates the process of matchmaking and performs regular checks to make sure data is being hosted and served to the readers. 

# DatDot hosting network

DatDot hosting network of two main building blocks: 
- a **service logic**, managing storing and retreiving of the data (written in Javascript, using Hypercore protocol)
- a **blockchain logic**, managing incentivized relationship between hosting requests and offers (written in Rust, using Substrate framework)

## Service

Service handles the logic around hypercores. It manages dht connections, sending data between peers, local data verification and the storage. 

When a peer requests hosting for their hypercore data, a so called hosting setup event is emited to 3 encoders, 3 hosters and an attestor. Encoders compress the data, sign it and send it to the attestor who verifies it and sends it forward to the hosters who store the data on their computers.

After all the hosters have received and stored the data, hosting service officially starts and hosters join the DHT swarm to start responding to the data requests.

## Blockchain

DatDot chain is responsible for keeping track of user accounts, active hosting plans and the selection of peers for new hosting setup.

When peer requests new hosting, DatDot chain selects 3 peers for encoding, 3 peers for hosting and one peer for attesting the new hosting setup. Peers are selected based on:
- availability,
- performance (bandwidth, storage, latency), 
- geographical location and
- rating

After hosters start hosting hypercore data, chain verifies if work is really being done using 2 verification methods:

- **proof of delivery**

- **proof of storage**

If hoster successfully prooves they are storing and delivering the data to the readers, they are rewarded with DatDot tokens, which is stored on chain on the peer's account balance.

## Technology

DatDot is combining two extremely powerful technologies: 
- **hypercore** - a world of distributed data structures and
- **substrate** - a rust based custom blockhain builder

## Hypercore protocol

Hypercore protocol is a dataset synchronization protocol that does not assume a dataset is static or that the entire dataset will be downloaded. The protocol is agnostic to the underlying transport e.g. you could implement Hypercore protocol over carrier pigeon.

Its strengths are that data is hosted and distributed by many computers on the network, that it can work offline or with poor connectivity, that the original uploader can add or modify data while keeping a full history and that it can handle large amounts of data.

Hypercore protocol is a light, efficient and secure replication protocol, which makes it easy to build fast and scalable peer-to-peer applications.

Think of it as an append-only log, basically just a list you can only append to. In terms of normal array operations, it is a log where you can only call get(index), push(data) and retrieve the log length, but where you can never overwrite old entries.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9BPGFSS.png)

Protocol allows you to quickly distribute these kind of logs in a peer-to-peer fashion. Each peer can choose to download only the section of the log they are interested in, without having to download everything from the beginning.

When files are added to the Hypercore, each file gets split up into some number of chunks (blocks), and the chunks are then arranged into a Merkle tree, which is used later for version control and replication processes.

Each chunk of data has a corresponding hash. There are also parent hashes which verify the integrity of two other hashes. Parent hashes form a tree structure.

Each time the author adds new chunks they calculate a root hash and sign it with the Hypercore’s secret key. Downloaders can use the Hypercore’s public key to verify the signature, which in turn verifies the integrity of all the other hashes and chunks.

Hypercore is rarely used on its own. More powerful, multi-user data structures can be created by combining multiple cores. Hypercore's main purpose is to be a foundational software for peer-to-peer applications.

It can be used to store any kind of mutable datasets: research papers, company data, private backups, it is perfect for apps where user owns their data, for open public data, websites and apps, as a blockchain storage, for live streaming and more.

## Substrate

Substrate is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components. It comes with p2p networking, consensus algorithms, and cryptographic libraries out-of-the-box, for free.

Its modular design means you can reuse battle-tested libraries while building the custom components that matter most. Some components (aka pallets) are sufficiently general-purpose to be reused in many blockchains. Anyone is free to write and share useful pallets. There is a collection of popular pallets provided with Substrate. Here are some of them: 
- pallets for different consensus mechanisms (proof of work, proof odf stake, proof of authority),
- balances pallet for handling accounts and balances,
- pallets for different voting systems (democracy etc.),
- offchain worker pallet,
- multichain pallet,
- scheduler and many more

# How to use DatDot

You can use DatDot in in at least 3 ways:

- as a **substrate blockchain builder** you can use it as a pallet in your chain
- as a **hypercore protocol builder** you can use its API to host or publish hypercore based data
- as a **hypercore user** you can run it as a desktop app and use it as a gateway to the hypercore based apps in any browser

## Substrate blockchain builder

Substrate developers can use DatDot solution by adding our pallet which acts as a bridge between Hypercore protocol and Substrate directly to your chain. Pallet comes with a built-in incentive model which manages relationships between:
- data creators/publishers and
- data hosters

**DatDot pallet**

It can be used as any other pallet that comes default with Substrate. In our DatDot network it is used in combination with other pallets

To use a pallet in your chain, you'll have to follow these pretty straight forward steps:

1. Open the `your-chain/your-node/runtime/src/lib.rs`

2. **Add the external pallet to the cargo.toml**

    Because the pallet in our case is an internal pallet, we will instead use:

    `use pallet_datdot;`

3. **Add pallet_datdot as a trait to the runtime**

    ```rust
    impl pallet_datdot::Trait for Runtime {
      type Event = Event;
      type Hash = Hash;
      type Randomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
      type Proposal = Call;
      type PalletsOrigin = OriginCaller;
      type Scheduler = Scheduler;
      //parameter types
      type PerformanceAttestorCount = PerformanceAttestorCount;
      type ChallengeDelay = ChallengeDelay;
      type EncodingDuration = EncodingDuration;
      type AttestingDuration = AttestingDuration;
      type AmendmentFollowupDelay = AmendmentFollowupDelay;
      type ContractSetSize = ContractSetSize;
      type ContractActivationCap = ContractActivationCap;
      type EncodersPerContract = EncodersPerContract;
      type HostersPerContract = HostersPerContract;
      type AttestorsPerContract = AttestorsPerContract;
      type MaxSelectedPerRole = MaxSelectedPerRole;
    }
    ```

4. **Public Functions:**
```rust
    getBlockNumber(),
    newUser(),
    registerForWork(),
    publishFeed(),
    publishPlan(),
    amendmentReport(),
    submitStorageChallenge(),
    submitPerformanceChallenge(),
    listenToEvents(),
    getFeedByID(),
    getPlanByID(),
    getAmendmentByID(),
    getContractByID(),
    getStorageChallengeByID(),
    getPerformanceChallengeByID(),
    getItemByID(),
    getFeedKey(),
    getUserAddress(),
    getUserIDByNoiseKey(),
    getUserIDBySigningKey(),
    getHosterKey(),
    getEncoderKey(),
    getAttestorKey(),
    getSigningKey(),
```

5. **Storage queries:**

```rust
  getItemByID,
  getUserByID,
  getUserIDByNoiseKey,
  getUserIDBySigningKey,
  getFeedByID,
  getFeedByKey,
  getPlanByID,
  getAmendmentByID,
  getContractByID,
  getStorageChallengeByID,
  getPerformanceChallengeByID,
```

## Hypercore protocol builder

As a hypercore developer you can use DatDot to improve retreivability of the hypercore data for peers using your hypercore based app. You can access the following API to:

- create new hypercores
- request hosting plans for hypercores

```js
  const serviceAPI = {
    account_create(),
    account_update(),
    account_delete(),
    hosting_request(),
    hosting_update(),
    hosting_pause(),
    hosting_resume(),
    hosting_cancel()
  }
```

## Hypercore user

If you want to use DatDot as an app, visit datdot.org and click Install button to get the latest version of the app which will enable you to connect to other peers, who are also running the same protocol.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tnZetzJ.png)

DatDot app runs as a process in the background. You can decide when do you want it to be active (e.g. only at night, only over the weekends, all the time etc.) and how much resources you want to enable (e.g. bandwidth, storage etc.). You can also keep it running with recommended default setup and later adjust ot or simpl pause it when you need more resources for your work/fun.

Once you have DatDot app running on your computer, you can also access the world of hypercore apps from your favorite browser. Usually this is very tricky, since the https protocol that runs in the browsers does not support the peer-to-peer protocol, but by running a DatDot app, you are also running a hypercore deamon, wich makes the protocol finally available from any browser.

To create account, you will generate a public/private key pair and define the resources you are willing to offer to the network. DatDot app will propagate your offer to the network and match you with peers who need hosting services. For providing your resources to the netowrk, you will be rewarded with DatDot tokens.

Every DatDot account is at the same time a provider and a client. You can therefore provide and at the same time also request the hosting services.
